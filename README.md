# Thymleaf module for Play Framework(Scala)
A module for Play Framework(Scala) to use [Thymleaf] (http://thymeleaf.org) template engine as an alternative to [Twirl] (https://github.com/playframework/twirl), which is a standard Play Framework template engine.

Thymeleaf is an **XML / XHTML / HTML5** template engine that is suited for serving XHTML/HTML5 at the view layer of web applications. It is based on XML tags and attributes that define the execution of predefined logic on the DOM (Document Object Model), instead of explicitly writing that logic as code inside the template.

## Sample application
